<p>
Very basic neural network module that I made in Python using NumPy. It allows you to create neural networks and train with a simple API, similar to TensorFlow's Keras. 
  
It currently only has fully connected (dense) layers and some other convenience layers reshape and flatten. In the future I would like to add convolutional, maxpool, and dropout layers for convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

This project was mostly made to just with the goal of actually understand how neural networks and deep learning works.

## MNIST demo
<p>This is a demo of it after being trained on the MNIST dataset. I made the drawing GUI with Tkinter and all additional plots/graphs with Matplotlib.</p>
