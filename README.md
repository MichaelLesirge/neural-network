<p>Very basic neural network module that I made in Python. It currently only has fully connected layers but I want to add more types of layers in the future like convolutional, maxpool, and dropout so I can make convolutional neural networks. An example of how you would create a network my the module is shown</p>

## MNIST demo
<p>This is a demo of it after being trained on the MNIST dataset. I made the drawing GUI with Tkinter and all additional plots/graphs with Matplotlib.</p>
