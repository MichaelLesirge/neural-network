# Neural Network from scratch in Python

<p>Very basic neural network in Python using just NumPy. It currently only has fully connected layers but I want to add more types of layers in the future like convolutional, maxpool, and dropout so I can make convolutional neural networks.</p>

## MNIST demo
<p>This is a demo of it after being trained on the MNIST dataset. I made the drawing GUI with Tkinter and all additional plots/graphs with Matplotlib.</p>
