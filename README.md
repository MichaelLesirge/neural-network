# Neural Network from scratch in Python

<p>Very basic neural network module that I made in Python using NumPy. It allows you to create neural networks and train them in a very easy way, similar to Tensorflow's Keras. 
  
It currently only has fully connected / dense layers and some other convenience layers reshape and flatten. In the future I would like to add convolutional, maxpool, and dropout layers for convolutional neural networks.</p>

## MNIST demo
<p>This is a demo of it after being trained on the MNIST dataset. I made the drawing GUI with Tkinter and all additional plots/graphs with Matplotlib.</p>
