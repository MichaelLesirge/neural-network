# Pong Game
Pong made with python pygame. ~~At some point I want to train my neural network to play it.~~

### Update
I made this pong game before I made a neural network or had any idea what I was doing. After seven months of just sitting here I decided to just give it a dumb AI with no deep learning (since that's all it really needs) and call it done. Deep learning for pong is just extra work for the same (if not worse) result. For an actual project I finished with AI playing a retro game check out [Tetris](https://github.com/michael-lesirge/neural-network/tree/main/tetris).
