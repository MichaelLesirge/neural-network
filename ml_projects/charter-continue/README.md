# Charter Continue

<p>
The goal of this was to train a network to predict the next character in a random message. 
I obviously was not expecting to get any good results but I was hoping it would at least produce an occasional random word. 
Turns out it actually found the true best way to predict the next char: always guess e, the most common letter.  

I was going to delete this since it didn't do anything funny and it does not work but I decided to keep it just as a funny example of how **not** to get a neural network to learn something.
